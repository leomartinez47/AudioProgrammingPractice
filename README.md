I love music, music production, and music technology. So naturally I have an interest in audio programming.
This repository is my audio programming learning repo, designed to hold any small projects that I make related to audio/synthesis/dsp.

So far I've taken an assignment from my Software Practice class where we represented a sine curve, and reworked it into
representing a synthesized sine wave. Then I wrote a class to write audio data to a wav file and using the Sine class
created a wav file containing a 10 second sine wave playing an A (440hz).

Currently I'm working on expanding the Sine class into a more general Waveform class, that will represent any one of the four 
basic waveforms: sine, square, sawtooth, and triangle waves.

In the future I want to build on these ideas even further and build a synthesizer application, but baby steps.
